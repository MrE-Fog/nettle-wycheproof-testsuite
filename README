The Wycheproof Project is an extremely useful set of tests which define corner cases and known weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms.

Nettle is a cryptographic library developed by the Linkoping University, and comes pre-packaged in the Pike scripting language.

This project is an attempt to utilise the Pike scripting language to conduct the tests provided by the Wycheproof project against the Nettle library.

The test cases provided in testvectors/ are taken from https://github.com/google/wycheproof, under the apache-2.0 license.
